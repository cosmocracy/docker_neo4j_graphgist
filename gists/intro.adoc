= Neo4j Graph Gist =

Neo4j GraphGists are a way to share documents including Cypher queries.
The queries can be executed in an online console.
GraphGists can be used to share examples or ideas or outline a question you have.

You create a GraphGist by creating a https://gist.github.com/[GitHub Gist] in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] and enter the URL to it in the form on this page.
The GraphGist is just as private as the GitHub Gist you created.
To share a GraphGist, just share the URL the page gets after entering the Gist in the form.
